## Requirements
---

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`).

## Scaffold project website
---

You can create project cloning the repository using `gh repo clone lexibase/rdx` or `git repo clone https://github.com/lexibase/rdx.git`.  

```
gh repo clone lexibase/rdx
code rdx
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

## Project Structure
---

Only the contents inside `apps/web` are relevant for configuring and assembling your project. Minimal setup is required for it to function properly:

```folder
my-documentation
apps/
├── web
│   ├── app
│   │   ├── docs
|   |   |   ├── (archived)
|   |   |   ├── (canary)
|   |   |   ├── (versioned)
│   ├── rdx.config.ts
└── └── versions.json
```

## Project structure rundown
---

- `(archived)` - This is where you store archived versions - those that are no longer supported. See [archived config](/docs/canary/docs) for more details.
- `(canary)` - This section of the documentation is still under development and this not the main version. See [canary config](/docs/canary/docs) for more details.
- `(versioned)` - This is where you manage versioning for your documentation. The latest released version (the one with the highest number) is always considered the `current` version. See [versioned config](/docs/canary/docs) for more details. 

## Running the development server
---

Too see changes made to your `.mdx` files, you`ll need to either navigate to a different page or manually reload the current one, due to the server-side nature of how MDX content is loaded.

Congratulations! You have created your first RDX Documentation!
