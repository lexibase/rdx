## Archived
---

The `(archived)` folder stores versions you no longer support, but still want to keep publicly available for legacy compatibility.  
Each folder inside must be prefixed with `version-` followed by the version number.  
The internal structure of each versioned folder (e.g. `version-1.0.0`) should follow the same pattern used in `(canary)`, including category folders and `_category.json` files.

```
docs/(archived) # root directory
├── version-1.0.0
|   ├── cat-01 // folder name can be anyting
|   |   ├── _category.json // required config file
|   └── └── hello.mdx
```

## Canary
---

The `(canary)` folder is where you actively develop your documentation. It is not considered the ***current*** version by the system.  
Unlike `(archived)` and `(versioned)`, folders here don't use a prefix - each folder becomes a category in the sidebar.  
Each category folder must include a `_category.json` file to define sidebar settings.

```
docs/(canary) # root directory
├── cat-01 // folder name can be anyting
|   ├── _category.json
|   ├── hello.mdx
|   └── license.mdx
├── cat-02 // folder name can be anything
|   ├── _category.json
└── └── install.mdx
```
```
// _category.json
{
  "title": "string",
  "sidebar_position": Numb
}
```
- `title` - The category name displayd in the sidebar.
- `sidebar_position`: The position of the category in the sidebar.

## Versioned
---

The `(versioned)` folder contains released versions of your documentation. Like `(archived)`, each folder must be prefixed with `version-`.

```
docs/(versioned) # root directory
├── version-1.0.5\
|   ├── cat-01 // folder name can be anyting
|   |   ├── _category.json // required config file
|   |   ├── hello.mdx
└── └── └── license.mdx
```

The version with the highest number is always considered the **current** version.
