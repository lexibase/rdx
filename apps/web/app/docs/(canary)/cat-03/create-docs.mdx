## Create a Doc
---

To create a documentation page, add a `.mdx` file inside a folder within `(canary)`.  
The folder acts as a category, adn the `.mdx` file becomes the actual page.

```
// apps/web/app/docs/ # root directory of your docs
├── (canary)
│   └── cat-01  // folder name can be anyting
│   |   └── hello.mdx
├── ...
```
```

# Hello World

Are you ready to create the documentation for your project.

```

## Doc front matter
---

Front matter is required and provides metadata for your doc page.  

Each content plugin defines its own front matter schema, which helps enrich the default metadata inferred from the contet or other configuration.

Front matter must be placed at the very top of the file, wrapped in triple dashes `---`.   It's parsed using [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/).

```
